Chelsea\u0027s current Premier League form of LDLDW suggests they are struggling to find their rhythm, with only one win in their first five matches of the season. They have scored 25 goals yet have also conceded 15, indicating a leaky defense that Everton could capitalize on. In contrast, Everton\u0027s recent form shows they are in better shape, having secured four wins out of five matches, with their latest being a solid back-to-back victory that will boost their confidence heading into this encounter.\n\nHistorically, Chelsea has had the upper hand over Everton, winning two out of their last ten meetings. However, winning at home is not as commanding when contrasted with Everton\u0027s impressive away form this season, particularly their ability to score consistently, having netted 18 times while maintaining a modest defensive record of 17 goals conceded. Chelsea must tighten up defensively to avoid giving Everton\u0027s forwards any breathing room. With Chelsea\u0027s struggles in both understanding and executing their attacking play, the favor tilts towards Everton, who look more cohesive and motivated this season."
