    answer: "SportBot AI is an AI-powered sports analytics platform that helps you understand any match in 60 seconds. We provide real-time analysis including team form, injuries, key stats, and contextual insights — so you can make smarter decisions as a fan, creator, or analyst."
  },
  {
    question: "How will it help me?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is this a tipster service?",
    answer: "No. We don't give picks or tell you what to bet. SportBot AI is an educational tool that gives you understanding and context. You see the data, the analysis, and the insights — then you decide what it means for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What sports do you cover?",
    answer: "We cover all major sports including Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Champions League, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, Euroleague Basketball, and many more. Our AI works across soccer, basketball, American football, hockey, and other popular leagues."

// Pricing-specific FAQ data
export const pricingFAQData: FAQItem[] = [

    answer: "We accept all major cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) through the secure Stripe payment system."
  },
  {
    question: "Are analyses a guarantee of winnings?",
    answer: "No. SportBot AI is an analytical tool that provides estimates based on available data. Sports betting always carries risk and we cannot guarantee any outcome."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I get with the Free plan?",
    answer: "The Free plan includes 1 match analysis and 1 AI chat message to try out the platform before deciding to upgrade."
