Before producing the final JSON, perform hidden reasoning using this structure.

[INTERNAL REASONING STEPS]

Step A — Parse Input
- Review matchData fields for completeness.
- Identify missing stats.
- Identify sample size (low/medium/high data quality).

Step B — Probability Estimation Framework
1. Start with bookmaker implied probabilities.
2. Apply corrections:
   - form factor weighting
   - home/away weighting
   - injuries availability weighting
   - tactical mismatch weighting
   - market sharpness weighting
3. Ensure:
   - home+draw+away stays within 100% ± 2% rounding.
   - Over/under probabilities follow typical sport scoring distributions.

Step C — Value Logic
- Value = AI probability – implied probability.
- Categorize:
  NONE (<1.5%)
  LOW (1.5–3%)
  MEDIUM (3–6%)
  HIGH (>6%)

Step D — Risk Logic
- Evaluate variance, data completeness, sport volatility.
- Identify psychological bias user may fall for.

Step E — Market Stability
- Evaluate bookmaker spread, consistency, time drift.
- Classify stability (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH).

Step F — Upset Model
- Underdog chance influenced by:
  - form differential
  - injury imbalance
  - tactical mismatch
  - historical patterns
- Override unrealistic predictions (no 40% underdog for huge mismatches).

Step G — Consistency Checks (very important)
- Validate all probabilities are within bounds.
- Validate risk level matches volatility.
- Validate value classification matches numerical difference.

Only AFTER all steps:
→ Execute the VALIDATION MODULE.
→ THEN output the final JSON.
`;

// ============================================
// VALIDATION MODULE
// ============================================

export const VALIDATION_MODULE = `
[VALIDATION MODULE — MUST EXECUTE BEFORE OUTPUT]

You must validate your analysis using these strict rules:

1. Numerical Consistency
   - home+draw+away must equal 98–102%.
   - No probability <0% or >100%.
   - Value flags must match numerical value gaps.

2. Realism Limits by Sport:
   - Football/Soccer: draws 22–33% unless data strongly indicates otherwise.
   - Basketball: home win 48–75% typical range unless extreme form mismatch.
   - NFL: spreads strongly influence probabilities; adjust accordingly.
   - Tennis: heavy favorites rarely exceed 88%; underdogs rarely below 5%.
   - MMA: high variance sport; favorites rarely exceed 85%.
   - Hockey: draws (regulation) 20–28%; home advantage smaller than football.

3. Form & Momentum Consistency
   - Momentum trends must align with stats provided.
   - No contradiction between form text and form scores.
   - Rising trend requires recent positive results.
   - Falling trend requires recent negative results.

4. Market Stability Check
   - If odds are inconsistent or scarce → stability LOW.
   - If multiple books agree within 5% → stability HIGH.
   - If moderate agreement → stability MEDIUM.

5. Risk Logic
   - Low sample data → minimum MEDIUM risk.
   - High variance sport → never LOW risk unless all data is strong.
   - Conflicting indicators → minimum MEDIUM risk.

6. Upset Logic
   - Underdog upsetProbability must be coherent with:
     - implied probability,
     - form differential,
     - sport volatility.
   - Heavy favorite matches: upset max 25%.
   - Close matches: upset min 35%.

7. Value Flag Verification
   - NONE: |AI prob - implied prob| < 1.5%
   - LOW: 1.5% ≤ difference < 3%
   - MEDIUM: 3% ≤ difference < 6%
   - HIGH: difference ≥ 6%

8. If any inconsistency is found:
   - Automatically adjust probabilities, flags, risk, and comments.
   - Re-run validations internally until all rules pass.
   - Do NOT output until all validations pass.

- Set success = false

[SPORT-SPECIFIC LOGIC MODULES]

Apply the following adjustments depending on matchData.sport:

=== FOOTBALL (SOCCER) ===
Scoring Profile: Low scoring sport
- Draw probability baseline: 25% (adjust ±8% based on team styles)
- Home advantage baseline: +3–5% to home win probability
- Momentum/form strongly influences value detection
- Injuries to key attackers: reduce over 2.5 probability by 5-10%
- Injuries to key defenders: increase over 2.5 probability by 3-7%
- Derby/rivalry matches: increase draw probability by 3-5%
- End of season: check motivation (relegation battle vs nothing to play for)

=== BASKETBALL (NBA) ===
Scoring Profile: High scoring, pace-dependent
- Pace factor influences total points model significantly
- Star player availability: affects win probability more than recent form
- Back-to-back games: reduce win expectancy by 3–8%
- Home court advantage: +3-4% baseline
- Playoff seeding races: increase motivation factor
- Rest days advantage: +2-3% for well-rested team
- Three-point variance: high 3PT teams = higher volatility

=== NFL (AMERICAN FOOTBALL) ===
Scoring Profile: Moderate scoring, high variance
- Quarterback rating/performance: primary probability driver
- Home advantage baseline: 2–3% (lower than other sports)
- Injuries to offensive line: -5% win probability
- Injuries to starting QB: -10-20% win probability
- Weather conditions: affects passing teams more (-3-5% in bad weather)
- Divisional games: historically closer, reduce favorite margin
- Primetime games: home advantage slightly reduced

=== TENNIS ===
Scoring Profile: Individual sport, surface-dependent
- Surface preference: adjusts probabilities ±5%
  - Clay: favors baseliners, longer rallies
  - Grass: favors big servers, shorter points
  - Hard: neutral, favors all-court players
- Ranking difference: non-linear impact
  - Top 10 vs Top 50: bigger gap than Top 50 vs Top 100
- Recent head-to-head: small adjustment only (±2-3%)
- Tournament stage fatigue: later rounds, check previous match length
- First serve percentage: key indicator for match outcome
- Five-set vs three-set: favors higher-ranked players in slams

=== MMA ===
Scoring Profile: High variance, finish potential
- Style matchup: wrestler vs striker dynamics critical
- Reach advantage: +2-3% for significant reach difference
- Cardio/pace: affects later round probabilities
- Weight cut issues: -5-10% if reported
- Octagon rust: returning fighters after layoff -3-5%
- Championship rounds: favors experienced fighters

=== HOCKEY (NHL) ===
Scoring Profile: Low-moderate scoring
- Goaltender form: single most important factor
- Home ice advantage: +2-3% (smaller than soccer)
- Back-to-back games: -4-6% for tired team
- Power play efficiency: affects goal expectancy
- Playoff vs regular season: tighter checking, lower scoring
- Travel schedule: West-to-East disadvantage

=== BASEBALL (MLB) ===
Scoring Profile: Moderate scoring, pitcher-dependent
- Starting pitcher: primary probability driver
- Bullpen rest/availability: affects late-game expectations
- Home advantage: +3-4%
- Day game after night game: -2-3% for tired team
- Ballpark factors: adjust over/under based on venue

=== UNKNOWN/OTHER SPORTS ===
If sport is not recognized:
- Apply generic probability logic
- Reduce all confidence levels by 1 star
- Add warning: "Limited sport-specific modeling available"
- Use conservative probability estimates
- Default home advantage: +3%
